[code-of-conduct]: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ We are excited that you want to contribute a new workflow to this repo. By doing this you are helping people get up and running with GitHub Actions and that's cool ðŸ˜Ž.

Contributions to this project are [released](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#6-contributions-under-repository-license) to the public under the [project's open source license](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/LICENSE).

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](
https://github.com/actions/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

**At this time we are only accepting new starter workflows for Code Scanning**

### Previous guidelines for new starter workflows.

Before merging a new workflow, the following requirements need to be met:

- Should be as simple as is needed for the service.
- There are many programming languages and tools out there. Right now we don't have a page that allows for a really large number of workflows, so we do have to be a little choosy about what we accept. Less popular tools or languages might not be accepted.
- Automation and CI workflows should not send data to any 3rd party service except for the purposes of installing dependencies.
- Automation and CI workflows cannot be dependent on a paid service or product.
- We require that Actions outside of the `actions` organization be pinned to a specific SHA.

Thank you
