# This workflow will validate the IAM policies in the CloudFormation (CFN) templates with using the standard and custom checks in AWS IAM Access Analyzer
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
# 1. Configure an AWS IAM role to use the Access Analyzer's ValidatePolicy, CheckNoNewAccess and CheckAccessNotGranted. This IAM role must be configured to call from the GitHub Actions, use the following [doc](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/use-iam-roles-to-connect-github-actions-to-actions-in-aws/) for steps. In the below workflow, ARN of such role is stored in the GitHub secrets with name `POLICY_VALIDATOR_ROLE`
# 2. Copy this workflow and add it under .github/workflows folder of your GitHub repository with name `policy-validator-iam-policies-cfn.yaml`
# 3. If you're using CheckNoNewAccess check, you need to create a reference policy. Use the guide [here](https://github.com/aws-samples/iam-access-analyzer-custom-policy-check-samples?tab=readme-ov-file#how-do-i-write-my-own-reference-policies)and store them in S3 bucket / GitHub secrets to compare them against the policies in the CFN templates. In below workflow, we are storing the reference policy in the GitHub secrets with name `REFERENCE_IDENTITY_POLICY`
# 4. If you're using the CheckAccessNotGranted check, identify the critical actions that shouldn't be granted access by the policies in the CFN templates. Store these actions in S3 bucket / GitHub secrets to compare them against the policies in the CFN templates. In the below workflow, we are storing the S3 bucket object containing the critical action in the GitHub secret with name `CRITICAL_ACTIONS`
# 5. Create a new workflow under ./github/workflows and refer this workflow. Configure the workflow with events to run and path to the CFN templates to be validated. Reference sample code: 
# ```
# name: Policy Validator for AWS IAM policies in CloudFormation templates
# on:
#   pull_request:
#     types: [opened, review_requested]
#   push:
#     branches:
#       - 'main'
# jobs:
#     security-scanner-developers:
#         uses: .github/workflows/policy-validator-iam-policies-cfn.yaml@main
#         secrets: inherit
#         with:
#             template-path: file-path-to-cfn-template.yaml
#             region: us-west-2
# ```
# 4. Start using the GitHub actions by generating the GitHub events matching the defined criteria in your workflow.
