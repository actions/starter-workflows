# Public Rest API for Binance (2021-08-12)

## General API Information
* The base endpoint is: **https://api.binance.com**
* If there are performance issues with the endpoint above, these API clusters are also available:
  * **https://api1.binance.com**
  * **https://api2.binance.com**
  * **https://api3.binance.com**
* All endpoints return either a JSON object or array.
* Data is returned in **ascending** order. Oldest first, newest last.
* All time and timestamp related fields are in **milliseconds**.

## HTTP Return Codes

* HTTP `4XX` return codes are used for malformed requests;
  the issue is on the sender's side.
* HTTP `403` return code is used when the WAF Limit (Web Application Firewall) has been violated.
* HTTP `429` return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
* HTTP `418` return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving `429` codes.
* HTTP `5XX` return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on
  Binance's side.
  It is important to **NOT** treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is
  **UNKNOWN** and could have been a success.


## Error Codes
* Any endpoint can return an ERROR

Sample Payload below:
```javascript
{
  "code": -1121,
  "msg": "Invalid symbol."
}
```
* Specific error codes and messages are defined in [Errors Codes](./errors.md).

## General Information on Endpoints
* For `GET` endpoints, parameters must be sent as a `query string`.
* For `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints, the parameters may be sent as a
  `query string` or in the `request body` with content type
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. You may mix parameters between both the
  `query string` and `request body` if you wish to do so.
* Parameters may be sent in any order.
* If a parameter sent in both the `query string` and `request body`, the
  `query string` parameter will be used.

# LIMITS

## General Info on Limits
* The following `intervalLetter` values for headers:
    * SECOND => S
    * MINUTE => M
    * HOUR => H
    * DAY => D
* `intervalNum` describes the amount of the interval. For example, `intervalNum` 5 with `intervalLetter` M means "Every 5 minutes".
* The `/api/v3/exchangeInfo` `rateLimits` array contains objects related to the exchange's `RAW_REQUESTS`, `REQUEST_WEIGHT`, and `ORDERS` rate limits. These are further defined in the `ENUM definitions` section under `Rate limiters (rateLimitType)`.
* A 429 will be returned when either rate limit is violated.

## IP Limits
* Every request will contain `X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)` in the response headers which has the current used weight for the IP for all request rate limiters defined.
* Each route has a `weight` which determines for the number of requests each endpoint counts for. Heavier endpoints and endpoints that do operations on multiple symbols will have a heavier `weight`.
* When a 429 is received, it's your obligation as an API to back off and not spam the API.
* **Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving 429s will result in an automated IP ban (HTTP status 418).**
* IP bans are tracked and **scale in duration** for repeat offenders, **from 2 minutes to 3 days**.
* A `Retry-After` header is sent with a 418 or 429 responses and will give the **number of seconds** required to wait, in the case of a 429, to prevent a ban, or, in the case of a 418, until the ban is over.
* **The limits on the API are based on the IPs, not the API keys.**

## Order Rate Limits
* Every successful order response will contain a `X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-(intervalNum)(intervalLetter)` header which has the current order count for the account for all order rate limiters defined.
* Rejected/unsuccessful orders are not guaranteed to have `X-MBX-ORDER-COUNT-**` headers in the response.
* **The order rate limit is counted against each account**.

# Data Sources
* The API system is asynchronous, so some delay in the response is normal and expected.
* Each endpoint has a data source indicating where the data is being retrieved, and thus which endpoints have the most up-to-date response.

These are the three sources, ordered by which is has the most up-to-date response to the one with potential delays in updates.

  * **Matching Engine** - the data is from the matching Engine
  * **Memory** - the data is from a server's local or external memory
  * **Database** - the data is taken directly from a database

Some endpoints can have more than 1 data source. (e.g. Memory => Database)
This means that the endpoint will check the first Data Source, and if it cannot find the value it's looking for it will check the next one.

# Endpoint security type
* Each endpoint has a security type that determines how you will
  interact with it. This is stated next to the NAME of the endpoint.
    * If no security type is stated, assume the security type is NONE.
* API-keys are passed into the Rest API via the `X-MBX-APIKEY`
  header.
* API-keys and secret-keys **are case sensitive**.
* API-keys can be configured to only access certain types of secure endpoints.
 For example, one API-key could be used for TRADE only, while another API-key
 can access everything except for TRADE routes.
* By default, API-keys can access all secure routes.

Security Type | Description
------------ | ------------
NONE | Endpoint can be accessed freely.
TRADE | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.
USER_DATA | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.
USER_STREAM | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key.
MARKET_DATA | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key.


* `TRADE` and `USER_DATA` endpoints are `SIGNED` endpoints.

# SIGNED (TRADE and USER_DATA) Endpoint security
* `SIGNED` endpoints require an additional parameter, `signature`, to be
  sent in the  `query string` or `request body`.
* Endpoints use `HMAC SHA256` signatures. The `HMAC SHA256 signature` is a keyed `HMAC SHA256` operation.
  Use your `secretKey` as the key and `totalParams` as the value for the HMAC operation.
* The `signature` is **not case sensitive**.
* `totalParams` is defined as the `query string` concatenated with the
  `request body`.

## Timing security
* A `SIGNED` endpoint also requires a parameter, `timestamp`, to be sent which
  should be the millisecond timestamp of when the request was created and sent.
* An additional parameter, `recvWindow`, may be sent to specify the number of
  milliseconds after `timestamp` the request is valid for. If `recvWindow`
  is not sent, **it defaults to 5000**.
* The logic is as follows:
  ```javascript
  if (timestamp < (serverTime + 1000) && (serverTime - timestamp) <= recvWindow) {
    // process request
  } else {
    // reject request
  }
  ```

**Serious trading is about timing.** Networks can be unstable and unreliable,
which can lead to requests taking varying amounts of time to reach the
servers. With `recvWindow`, you can specify that the request must be
processed within a certain number of milliseconds or be rejected by the
server.


**It is recommended to use a small recvWindow of 5000 or less! The max cannot go beyond 60,000!**


## SIGNED Endpoint Examples for POST /api/v3/order
Here is a step-by-step example of how to send a valid signed payload from the
Linux command line using `echo`, `openssl`, and `curl`.

Note that the signature is different in example 3.
There is no & between "GTC" and "quantity=1".

# Public API Endpoints
### Terminology

These terms will be used throughout the documentation, so it is recommended especially for new users to read to help their understanding of the API.

* `base asset` refers to the asset that is the `quantity` of a symbol. For the symbol BTCUSDT, BTC would be the `base asset`.
* `quote asset` refers to the asset that is the `price` of a symbol. For the symbol BTCUSDT, USDT would be the `quote asset`.

## Account endpoints
### New order  (TRADE)
```
POST /api/v3/order  (HMAC SHA256)
```
Send in a new order.

**Weight:**
1

**Parameters:**

Name | Type | Mandatory | Description
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------
symbol | STRING | YES |
side | ENUM | YES |
type | ENUM | YES |
timeInForce | ENUM | NO |
quantity | DECIMAL | NO |
quoteOrderQty|DECIMAL|NO|
price | DECIMAL | NO |
newClientOrderId | STRING | NO | A unique id among open orders. Automatically generated if not sent.<br> Orders with the same `newClientOrderID` can be accepted only when the previous one is filled, otherwise the order will be rejected.
stopPrice | DECIMAL | NO | Used with `STOP_LOSS`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, `TAKE_PROFIT`, and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` orders.
icebergQty | DECIMAL | NO | Used with `LIMIT`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` to create an iceberg order.
newOrderRespType | ENUM | NO | Set the response JSON. `ACK`, `RESULT`, or `FULL`; `MARKET` and `LIMIT` order types default to `FULL`, all other orders default to `ACK`.
recvWindow | LONG | NO |The value cannot be greater than ```60000```
timestamp | LONG | YES |

Some additional mandatory parameters based on order `type`:

Type | Additional mandatory parameters | Additional Information
------------ | ------------| ------
`LIMIT` | `timeInForce`, `quantity`, `price`| 
`MARKET` | `quantity` or `quoteOrderQty`| `MARKET` orders using the `quantity` field specifies the amount of the `base asset` the user wants to buy or sell at the market price. <br> E.g. MARKET order on BTCUSDT will specify how much BTC the user is buying or selling. <br><br> `MARKET` orders using `quoteOrderQty` specifies the amount the user wants to spend (when buying) or receive (when selling) the `quote` asset; the correct `quantity` will be determined based on the market liquidity and `quoteOrderQty`. <br> E.g. Using the symbol BTCUSDT: <br> `BUY` side, the order will buy as many BTC as `quoteOrderQty` USDT can. <br> `SELL` side, the order will sell as much BTC needed to receive `quoteOrderQty` USDT.
`STOP_LOSS` | `quantity`, `stopPrice`| This will execute a `MARKET` order when the `stopPrice` is reached.
`STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` | `timeInForce`, `quantity`,  `price`, `stopPrice` 
`TAKE_PROFIT` | `quantity`, `stopPrice`| This will execute a `MARKET` order when the `stopPrice` is reached.
`TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` | `timeInForce`, `quantity`, `price`, `stopPrice` | 
`LIMIT_MAKER` | `quantity`, `price`| This is a `LIMIT` order that will be rejected if the order immediately matches and trades as a taker. <br> This is also known as a POST-ONLY order. 

Other info:

* Any `LIMIT` or `LIMIT_MAKER` type order can be made an iceberg order by sending an `icebergQty`.
* Any order with an `icebergQty` MUST have `timeInForce` set to `GTC`.
* `MARKET` orders using `quoteOrderQty` will not break `LOT_SIZE` filter rules; the order will execute a `quantity` that will have the notional value as close as possible to `quoteOrderQty`.
Trigger order price rules against market price for both MARKET and LIMIT versions:

* Price above market price: `STOP_LOSS` `BUY`, `TAKE_PROFIT` `SELL`
* Price below market price: `STOP_LOSS` `SELL`, `TAKE_PROFIT` `BUY`

* For some historical orders `cummulativeQuoteQty` will be < 0, meaning the data is not available at this time.
* If `startTime` and/or `endTime` provided, `orderId`  is not required.

# Filters
Filters define trading rules on a symbol or an exchange.
Filters come in two forms: `symbol filters` and `exchange filters`.

## Symbol filters
### PRICE_FILTER
The `PRICE_FILTER` defines the `price` rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

* `minPrice` defines the minimum `price`/`stopPrice` allowed; disabled on `minPrice` == 0.
* `maxPrice` defines the maximum `price`/`stopPrice` allowed; disabled on `maxPrice` == 0.
* `tickSize` defines the intervals that a `price`/`stopPrice` can be increased/decreased by; disabled on `tickSize` == 0.

Any of the above variables can be set to 0, which disables that rule in the `price filter`. In order to pass the `price filter`, the following must be true for `price`/`stopPrice` of the enabled rules:

* `price` >= `minPrice`
* `price` <= `maxPrice`
* (`price`-`minPrice`) % `tickSize` == 0

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
{
  "filterType": "PRICE_FILTER",
  "minPrice": "0.00000100",
  "maxPrice": "100000.00000000",
  "tickSize": "0.00000100"
}
```

### PERCENT_PRICE
The `PERCENT_PRICE` filter defines valid range for a price based on the average of the previous trades.
`avgPriceMins` is the number of minutes the average price is calculated over. 0 means the last price is used.

In order to pass the `percent price`, the following must be true for `price`:
* `price` <= `weightedAveragePrice` * `multiplierUp`
* `price` >= `weightedAveragePrice` * `multiplierDown`

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
{
  "filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE",
  "multiplierUp": "1.3000",
  "multiplierDown": "0.7000",
  "avgPriceMins": 5
}
```

### LOT_SIZE
The `LOT_SIZE` filter defines the `quantity` (aka "lots" in auction terms) rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

* `minQty` defines the minimum `quantity`/`icebergQty` allowed.
* `maxQty` defines the maximum `quantity`/`icebergQty` allowed.
* `stepSize` defines the intervals that a `quantity`/`icebergQty` can be increased/decreased by.

In order to pass the `lot size`, the following must be true for `quantity`/`icebergQty`:

* `quantity` >= `minQty`
* `quantity` <= `maxQty`
* (`quantity`-`minQty`) % `stepSize` == 0

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
{
  "filterType": "LOT_SIZE",
  "minQty": "0.00100000",
  "maxQty": "100000.00000000",
  "stepSize": "0.00100000"
}
```

### MIN_NOTIONAL
The `MIN_NOTIONAL` filter defines the minimum notional value allowed for an order on a symbol.
An order's notional value is the `price` * `quantity`.
`applyToMarket` determines whether or not the `MIN_NOTIONAL` filter will also be applied to `MARKET` orders.
Since `MARKET` orders have no price, the average price is used over the last `avgPriceMins` minutes.
`avgPriceMins` is the number of minutes the average price is calculated over. 0 means the last price is used.


**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
{
  "filterType": "MIN_NOTIONAL",
  "minNotional": "0.00100000",
  "applyToMarket": true,
  "avgPriceMins": 5
}
```

### ICEBERG_PARTS
The `ICEBERG_PARTS` filter defines the maximum parts an iceberg order can have. The number of `ICEBERG_PARTS` is defined as `CEIL(qty / icebergQty)`.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
{
  "filterType": "ICEBERG_PARTS",
  "limit": 10
}
```

### MARKET_LOT_SIZE
The `MARKET_LOT_SIZE` filter defines the `quantity` (aka "lots" in auction terms) rules for `MARKET` orders on a symbol. There are 3 parts:

* `minQty` defines the minimum `quantity` allowed.
* `maxQty` defines the maximum `quantity` allowed.
* `stepSize` defines the intervals that a `quantity` can be increased/decreased by.

In order to pass the `market lot size`, the following must be true for `quantity`:

* `quantity` >= `minQty`
* `quantity` <= `maxQty`
* (`quantity`-`minQty`) % `stepSize` == 0

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
{
  "filterType": "MARKET_LOT_SIZE",
  "minQty": "0.00100000",
  "maxQty": "100000.00000000",
  "stepSize": "0.00100000"
}
```

### MAX_NUM_ORDERS
The `MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol.
Note that both "algo" orders and normal orders are counted for this filter.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
{
  "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ORDERS",
  "maxNumOrders": 25
}
```

### MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS
The `MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of "algo" orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol.
"Algo" orders are `STOP_LOSS`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, `TAKE_PROFIT`, and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` orders.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
{
  "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS",
  "maxNumAlgoOrders": 5
}
```

### MAX_NUM_ICEBERG_ORDERS
The `MAX_NUM_ICEBERG_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of `ICEBERG` orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol.
An `ICEBERG` order is any order where the `icebergQty` is > 0.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
{
  "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ICEBERG_ORDERS",
  "maxNumIcebergOrders": 5
}
```

### MAX_POSITION 

The `MAX_POSITION` filter defines the allowed maximum position an account can have on the base asset of a symbol. An account's position defined as the sum of the account's:
1. free balance of the base asset
1. locked balance of the base asset
1. sum of the qty of all open BUY orders

`BUY` orders will be rejected if the account's position is greater than the maximum position allowed.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
{
  "filterType":"MAX_POSITION",
  "maxPosition":"10.00000000"
}
```


## Exchange Filters
### EXCHANGE_MAX_NUM_ORDERS
The `MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of orders an account is allowed to have open on the exchange.
Note that both "algo" orders and normal orders are counted for this filter.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
{
  "filterType": "EXCHANGE_MAX_NUM_ORDERS",
  "maxNumOrders": 1000
}
```

### EXCHANGE_MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS
The `MAX_ALGO_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of "algo" orders an account is allowed to have open on the exchange.
"Algo" orders are `STOP_LOSS`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, `TAKE_PROFIT`, and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` orders.

**/exchangeInfo format:**
```javascript
{
  "filterType": "EXCHANGE_MAX_ALGO_ORDERS",
  "maxNumAlgoOrders": 200
}
```
